This is a projectile (cat) shooting game developed by me, Roy Niu (programmer) and Matthew Shin (artist).

I implemented the cat shooting, environment and enemy instantiating and game state tracking part.

How To Play:

Hold down mouse to shoot
Attach onto the blue pillars
Jump onto the while squares(ghosts) to kill them
Killed by ghost if gets hit by side
Sit on yellow rectangles(humen) to cheer them up (restore their health), and prevent them from getting desperate due to the influence of the ghost.
