This game is written based on a simple game engine structure provided by Sanjay Madhav with a large amount of actual code implementation done by myself. SDL and OpenGL libraries are used to support the basic game engine functions.

To Play:
Click : Select Tile
Num 1 : Build Frost Tower on Selected Tile
Num 2 : Build Cannon Tower on Selected Tile

Each time enemy getting into the base would deduct health. Game over when health reaches 0.
Each time killing an enemy would add money. Building towers would cost money.
