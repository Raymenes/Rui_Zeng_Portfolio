This painting application is written based on a Model-View-Controller structure provided by Sanjay Madhav with a large amount of actual code implementation done by myself. The application utilizes WX GUI Library to achieve the basic functions.

Click on toolbar to choose to draw different shapes or perform operations on the shapes. Can select/deselect, move, delete, import and export images.
