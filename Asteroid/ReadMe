This game is written based on a simple game engine structure provided by Sanjay Madhav with a large amount of actual code implementation done by myself. SDL and OpenGL libraries are used to support the basic game engine functions.

To Play:
WASD : Moving
Space Bar : Shooting
Die when hit by asteroids, and will respawn in a few seconds
